            <h1>Exploring Brain Tumor Classification</h1>

            <p>
                Welcome to our exploration of brain tumor classification, a vital aspect of modern medical diagnostics.
                As
                technology continues to advance, so does our ability to understand and categorize various types of brain
                tumors with greater precision.
            </p>

            <h2>The Importance of Classification</h2>
            <p>
                Brain tumors are complex, and their characteristics can vary widely. Accurate classification is crucial
                for
                determining the most effective treatment strategies and understanding the prognosis for patients. Recent
                advancements in medical imaging and machine learning have played a pivotal role in enhancing our ability
                to
                classify brain tumors based on their features and patterns.
            </p>

            <h2>About Brain Tumor Classification Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Our Brain Tumor Classification platform is designed to provide information and potential assistance in
                the
                classification of brain tumors. While this is a simplified example for demonstration purposes, the
                integration of predictive models based on real-world data is a promising avenue for the future of
                medical
                diagnostics.
            </p>

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
                By leveraging sophisticated algorithms, the platform analyzes imaging data to identify patterns
                indicative
                of different types of brain tumors. Users can engage with the prediction button to simulate the
                classification process. Please note that in this demo, the prediction button is a placeholder and
                doesn't
                perform any actual classification.

            <p>
                As we delve into the realm of brain tumor classification, it's important to recognize the collaborative
                efforts of medical professionals, researchers, and technologists working towards advancements that
                positively impact patient outcomes.
